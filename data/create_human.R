# There are 195 observations of 19 variables. The variables are named 
# "HDIR" for HDI rank, "Country" for country, "HDIx" for Human development index, "LifeEx" for Life expectancy at birth,
# "ExEd" for Expected years of education, "MeanEdYears" for Mean years of education,  "GNI" for Gross National Income per capita,
# "GNIRlessHDIR" is GNI minus HDI rank, "GIIR" for GII rank, "GIIx" for Gender inequality index, "MotherDeathR" for Maternal mortality ratio,
# "AdolBirthR" for Adolescent birth rate, "RepInParl" for Percent of Representation in Parliament, 
# "F2Ed" for Female population with secondary education, "M2Ed" Male population with secondary education,
# "FLabour" for Female labour force participation rate, "MLabour" Male labour force participation rate, 
# "FM2Rat" for the new  ratio of Female and Male populations with secondary education in each country
# "FMLabourRat" for the new ratio of Female and Male populations labour force participation in each country. 

# Mutation of data: transform the Gross National Income (GNI) variable to numeric
# saving the non-mutated human data just in case (not required by the task)
savehuman <- human
# doing the actual  mutation, there is a need to change decimal commas to decimal dots for R to understand that it's a number

# checking the structure of the dataframe

# The GNI variable shows rounded values  "GNI         : num  65 42.3 56.4 44 45.4 ..." but the check above confirmed that the saved values have 3 decimals

# Excluding unnecessary columns, keeping those that match "Mat.Mor", "Ado.Birth", "Parli.F"
# to make things simpler, I'll rename my to-keep columns first with the task given column names:

colnames(human)[12] <- "Ado.Birth"
colnames(human)[13] <- "Parli.F"
colnames(human)
# now let's keep only the columns "Country", "Edu2.FM", "Labo.FM", "Edu.Exp", "Life.Exp", "GNI", "Mat.Mor", "Ado.Birth", "Parli.F"
keep_columns <- c("Country", "Edu2.FM", "Labo.FM", "Edu.Exp", "Life.Exp", "GNI", "Mat.Mor", "Ado.Birth", "Parli.F")
