if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") 
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, forcats, haven, janitor, psych, lm.beta, broom, writexl,sjstats, knitr, pwr, dplyr, GGally, ggplot2, boot)

This week we are taking a go at clustering and classification with RStudio's native Boston dataset. More information about the dataset can be found here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Boston.html.

```{r}
# load the data from MASS package
data(Boston)

# explore the dataset
str(Boston)
dim(Boston)
summary(Boston)
```
There are 506 observations of 14 variables, which include crime rate per capita in town (crim) and average rooms per dwelling (rm) among others.
